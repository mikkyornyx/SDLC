# SDLC library of security controls, practices and process steps
| - | - | - | - | - |

| Name  | Description | Phase | Type | Function |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Process stage  | Process step references standard process alignment and activities that are required to kickstart an initiative.  | Plan | Administrative | Preventive |
| Idea  | Idea step references start of activity. Depending on Enterprise Architecture steps definition, it can be named differently.  | Plan | Administrative |  |
| Feature definition  | In the feature definition step business defines which features and security requirements product needs to have and align to. This step is an input to Design and Architecture.  | Plan | Technical |  |
| Architecture  | This step maps overall Architecture guidelines to future product, including which technologies to use, how to fit future product into organization portfolio, align it with Enterprise Architecture and practices used in the organization.  | Plan | Technical | Preventive |
| Compliance & Risk assessment  | Compliance & Risk assessment is an initial control step for process alignment. This step is needed to validate that future product will stay within compliance frame and that all risks that will be associated with it will stay within risk appetite. This step can also mandate and drive particular Design decisions. Third party and future Supplier Chain Management alignment with requirements also happens in this step.  | Plan | Administrative | Preventive |
| Design  | Design step takes Architecture as an input and creates product detailed design according to industry best practices. Output Design should be detailed enough for Threat Modelling evaluation.  | Plan | Technical | Preventive |
| Threat modelling  | Threat modelling along with Design, Compliance & Risk assessment and Architecture phases is residing in the recurrent "bubble". Threat modelling is a security process which identifies, categorizes and analyzes threats and vulnerabilities applicable for the product (application) being built. Output of this step is an actual model - design/diagram of the system, list of threats and controls for mitigation. There are multiple methodologies available for threat modelling, overall idea of this step is to identify gaps and also places where applicable countermeasures have greatest effect. In case it is not possible to mitigate risks to tolerable extent, Design and/or Architecture need to be fixed. In a way, Threat Modelling is a control gate of Planning phase.  | Plan | Technical | Preventive |
| CI/CD pipeline design | CI/CD pipeline design is an initial design of SDLC and related pipeline based on service Compliance Requirements, Threat Modelling, Design and other software requirements. | Plan | Administrative | Preventive |
| IDE SAST (Integrated Development Environment SAST) | IDE SAST is a simplified way to perform Static Application Security Testing in near real-time inside IDE. Most common and simple mistakes and security bugs will be identified early in the development process. This step can be circumvented as IDE SAST usually comes with a plugin that can be overridden, also it does not perform full-scale SAST test. SAST is considered to be White-Box testing technique, where entire source code is available for automated review. | Develop | Technical | Detective |
| IDE SCA (Integrated Development Environment SCA) | IDE Software Composition Analysis is yet again quick way to identify potential problems with both internal and external components that will be used later in the build process. This step can identify potential problems with outdated, vulnerable or blacklisted components (due to license restrictions, for example). This step can also be circumvented as it resides in IDE usually as a plugin. However, having such helper early in the process before commits and unit tests allows for faster fixes in software composition and choice of secure components. | Develop | Technical | Detective |
| Unit test | Code gets covered with unit tests that may include early security testing and controls verification, including security unit tests, regressions testing, specific abuse cases and business logic flaw tests. At this point, test can sometimes still be done using white-box approach, depending on application. | Develop | Technical | Detective |
| Pre-commit hooks | Pre-commit hooks as a chain of automated code checks can help code stay within prescribed boundaries and align with various organization-specific requirements. For example, pre-commit hooks can check whether code is covered with comments, test cases, specific notation requirements, etc. so that it will pass further validation steps in the pipeline. | Develop | Technical | Detective |
| Secrets scanning | Secrets scanning step is a control gate that happens before commit and can be related to pre-commit hooks (or be one of the pre-commit hooks). Goal of this step is to ensure that code being committed to repository outside development IDE does not contain any sensitive data - production tokens, secrets etc. Secrets scanning is usually done using plugin or simple regex rules that look for specific patterns in the code. | Develop | Technical | Detective |
| Commit | Commit is a straightforward step of transferring code securely into repository from the IDE. | Develop | Technical |  |
| Sign | For integrity and non-repudiation purposes, commit can be signed by a digital signature. This way, each commit can be tracked and it's integrity can be checked at any point of time. Existence of a valid signature is later checked in the pipeline and is a prerequisite to start rigorous security testing and builds. | Develop | Technical | Preventive |
| Code Quality & Metrics | Code Quality & Metrics step can be done in SAST tool, it checks for various parameters, including tests coverage, code reusability, code alignment to standards, number of bugs, mistakes and vulnerabilities and so on. This step produces valuable output that can be later used, for example, in focused education of problematic areas. | Build & Test | Administrative | Detective |
| Signature check | Signature check steps checks for existence of valid commit signature and code integrity in the commit repository. | Build & Test | Technical | Detective |
