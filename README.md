| - | - | - | - | - |

| Name  | Description | Phase | Type | Function |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Process stage  | Process step references standard process alignment and activities that are required to kickstart an initiative.  | Plan | Administrative | Preventive |
| Idea  | Idea step references start of activity. Depending on Enterprise Architecture steps definition, it can be named differently.  | Plan | Administrative |  |
| Feature definition  | In the feature definition step business defines which features and security requirements product needs to have and align to. This step is an input to Design and Architecture.  | Plan | Technical |  |
| Architecture  | This step maps overall Architecture guidelines to future product, including which technologies to use, how to fit future product into organization portfolio, align it with Enterprise Architecture and practices used in the organization.  | Plan | Technical | Preventive |
| Compliance & Risk assessment  | Compliance & Risk assessment is an initial control step for process alignment. This step is needed to validate that future product will stay within compliance frame and that all risks that will be associated with it will stay within risk appetite. This step can also mandate and drive particular Design decisions. Third party and future Supplier Chain Management alignment with requirements also happens in this step.  | Plan | Administrative | Preventive |
| Design  | Design step takes Architecture as an input and creates product detailed design according to industry best practices. Output Design should be detailed enough for Threat Modelling evaluation.  | Plan | Technical | Preventive |
| Threat modelling  | Threat modelling along with Design, Compliance & Risk assessment and Architecture phases is residing in the recurrent "bubble". Threat modelling is a security process which identifies, categorizes and analyzes threats and vulnerabilities applicable for the product (application) being built. Output of this step is an actual model - design/diagram of the system, list of threats and controls for mitigation. There are multiple methodologies available for threat modelling, overall idea of this step is to identify gaps and also places where applicable countermeasures have greatest effect. In case it is not possible to mitigate risks to tolerable extent, Design and/or Architecture need to be fixed. In a way, Threat Modelling is a control gate of Planning phase.  | Plan | Technical | Preventive |
| CI/CD pipeline design | CI/CD pipeline design is an initial design of SDLC and related pipeline based on service Compliance Requirements, Threat Modelling, Design and other software requirements. | Plan | Administrative | Preventive |
| IDE SAST (Integrated Development Environment SAST) | IDE SAST is a simplified way to perform Static Application Security Testing in near real-time inside IDE. Most common and simple mistakes and security bugs will be identified early in the development process. This step can be circumvented as IDE SAST usually comes with a plugin that can be overridden, also it does not perform full-scale SAST test. SAST is considered to be White-Box testing technique, where entire source code is available for automated review. | Develop | Technical | Detective |
| IDE SCA (Integrated Development Environment SCA) | IDE Software Composition Analysis is yet again quick way to identify potential problems with both internal and external components that will be used later in the build process. This step can identify potential problems with outdated, vulnerable or blacklisted components (due to license restrictions, for example). This step can also be circumvented as it resides in IDE usually as a plugin. However, having such helper early in the process before commits and unit tests allows for faster fixes in software composition and choice of secure components. | Develop | Technical | Detective |
| Unit test | Code gets covered with unit tests that may include early security testing and controls verification, including security unit tests, regressions testing, specific abuse cases and business logic flaw tests. At this point, test can sometimes still be done using white-box approach, depending on application. | Develop | Technical | Detective |
| Pre-commit hooks | Pre-commit hooks as a chain of automated code checks can help code stay within prescribed boundaries and align with various organization-specific requirements. For example, pre-commit hooks can check whether code is covered with comments, test cases, specific notation requirements, etc. so that it will pass further validation steps in the pipeline. | Develop | Technical | Detective |
| Secrets scanning | Secrets scanning step is a control gate that happens before commit and can be related to pre-commit hooks (or be one of the pre-commit hooks). Goal of this step is to ensure that code being committed to repository outside development IDE does not contain any sensitive data - production tokens, secrets etc. Secrets scanning is usually done using plugin or simple regex rules that look for specific patterns in the code. | Develop | Technical | Detective |
| Commit | Commit is a straightforward step of transferring code securely into repository from the IDE. | Develop | Technical |  |
| Sign | For integrity and non-repudiation purposes, commit can be signed by a digital signature. This way, each commit can be tracked and it's integrity can be checked at any point of time. Existence of a valid signature is later checked in the pipeline and is a prerequisite to start rigorous security testing and builds. | Develop | Technical | Preventive |
| Code Quality & Metrics | Code Quality & Metrics step can be done in SAST tool, it checks for various parameters, including tests coverage, code reusability, code alignment to standards, number of bugs, mistakes and vulnerabilities and so on. This step produces valuable output that can be later used, for example, in focused education of problematic areas. | Build & Test | Administrative | Detective |
| Signature check | Signature check steps checks for existence of valid commit signature and code integrity in the commit repository. | Build & Test | Technical | Detective |
| SCA (Software Composition Analysis) | Software Composition Analysis step that is performed outside development IDE and checks for same things - whether referenced packages are vulnerable or not, what is their patch level, are they supported, does their licensing scheme suit enterprise. This SCA is a tollgate - step if fully automated and results from this check can be used by CI orchestrator to whether move on with the pipeline or break the process and fix the code. | Build & Test | Technical | Detective |
| SAST (Static Application Security Testing) | This is the same SAST testing, but more rigorous and automated. White-box test that can find out and identify bugs, vulnerabilities and alignment of the code to certain guidelines. SAST is a first security test that performs "code review" in automated fashion. It can also be a tollgate - depending of the configuration of the CI orchestrator it is possible to define a threshold or tolerable level of code quality for build to pass along the pipeline. | Build & Test | Technical | Detective |
| Peer Review | Peer review is a manual step in the process. Goal of peer review is to have a second pair of eyes to check that code is composed as it should be, all previous necessary steps were done and code is ready to be built. Peer review can identify some business flaws, twisted convoluted injections and vulnerabilities etc. | Build & Test | Technical | Detective |
| Accept | Accept step is a formal acceptance that ends up peer review in case it was successful. It can be in a form of merging code to main branch. | Build & Test | Administrative |  |
| Sign | After peer review acceptance, code is signed once again using signature of reviewer. In a later stages of the pipeline, two signatures are needed and validated. This indicates that code was formally reviewed and approved and ensures integrity and non-repudiation throughout the pipeline. | Build & Test | Technical | Preventive |
| Package | Code packaging is a step where written software gets assembled/compiled/packaged for further testing and deployment, depending on target platform and its architecture. For some particular packages, additional dependencies from artifact repositories get embedded. | Release & Test | Technical |  |
| Signature check | For packaging step to happen successfully, two signatures of both developer and code reviewer get validated. | Release & Test | Technical | Detective |
| Artifact repository | After software got packaged, it gets transferred/copied to artifact repository where it is securely stored for further deployment/reuse purposes. | Release & Test | Technical | Preventive |
| Versioning | Versioning step helps to keep track of different package versions of the same software. In case rollback or restore is needed, proper version is kept in artifact repository and allows to "restore in time" to a previously known good configuration. Each package can have multiple versions with different features. | Release & Test | Technical | Preventive |
| Deploy to Staging | For a Staging branch, deploy to staging means promoting package to become future version of production application/service. Rigorous security and other types of testing are ahead. | Release & Test | Technical |  |
| Integration testing | Functional testing is a step where application is validated against functional requirements and specifications. Normally, mainline functions, usability, accessibility and error handling are tested here. Testing is usually executed against known test cases and results are compared to expected ones.  | Release & Test | Technical | Detective |
| Functional testing | During the Integration testing, application is tested against other systems it needs to communicate with, also in case application is part of larger suite, interoperability between different components is tested during this phase. API interoperability testing is part of integration test. Integration & Functional testing are normally Black-box tests. | Release & Test | Technical | Detective |
| Regression test | Regression test can be seen as a step, where delta (minor) changes to application land - there is no reason to re-run entire pipeline synchronously in case only minor changes are introduced, rather regression testing is an entry point, where concrete tests are selected to check changed code. Regression test can also include test cases against previously found bugs to ensure they don't make they way into upcoming releases. For example, if there are multiple code branches and some of them contain bugs which aren't fixed in the branch, copying that branch or code parts will also introduce same bugs into the pipeline. Regression testing is performed as Black-box test. | Release & Test | Technical | Detective |
| DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) | Dynamic Application Security Testing is a Black box testing technique, where multiple tests are performed against working application and its interfaces. Formally, this security testing includes negative testing with unwanted input, fuzzing, various overflows, injections and so on. DAST is able to identify most common security misconfigurations and bugs in the code. DAST can also be referred to automated security verification test. | Release & Test | Technical | Detective |
| IAST (Interactive Application Security Testing) | Interactive Application Security Testing goes beyond DAST capabilities and injects program module or code into running application. IAST provides more capabilities for running similar checks that DAST performs and in addition to standard application interfaces can submit input directly into program routines, co-routines and modules. IAST is able to diagnose application in runtime and identify problematic lines of code. | Release & Test | Technical | Detective |
| Vulnerability testing | Vulnerability testing is applicable for the platform that will host future application in both staging and production environments. Goal of this step is to ensure that environment is set up correctly and that underlying OS or platform does not contain known vulnerabilities. This step should normally be fully-automated. | Release & Test | Technical | Detective |
| Configuration compliance | Configuration compliance is a step that refers to configuration hardening - it analyzes future environment/platform that application will be hosted on and compares it to best practice benchmarks (such as CIS) and compliance requirements. This step should normally be fully-automated. | Release & Test | Technical | Detective |
| Penetration testing | Penetration testing or formal manual Security Verification is a manual step of identifying vulnerabilities and security misconfigurations related to running application/service. This step is performed by skilled individuals based on industry best practices and prior experience. | Release & Test | Technical | Detective |
| Architecture compliance | Architecture compliance step generally controls that overall solution or application architecture is aligned with common requirements (Enterprise Architecture frameworks and guidelines, architecture blueprints, components mandated for use in the project and so on). General infrastructure and overall alignment are also checked in this step. | Release & Test | Technical | Detective |
| Security review | Security review is optional step in case mandatory pipeline steps and requirements have been followed. This is an additional check (or, depending on the process, it can be mandatory), that controls that overall solution and security architecture are aligned with internal requirements and follow industry best practices. | Release & Test | Technical | Detective |
| Requirements validation | Requirements validation is a step where solution is validated against initial formal and functional requirements. Features existence and quality are normally checked during this step. | Release & Test | Administrative | Detective |
| UAT (User Acceptance Test) | User Acceptance Test can be done as part of alpha of beta release. Normally, it is done either by automated tools or by a group of QA or even beta testers. Goal of this step is to formally approve solution from a user perspective. Design, UX/UI components testing and validation can also be done during this stage. | Release & Test | Technical | Detective |
| Business acceptance | Business acceptance is formal control gate that summarizes testing phase and validates staging candidate to become a production release. Normally, this is business approval that happens after all mandatory checks have been done and necessary processes followed. | Release & Test | Administrative | Detective |
| Business logic flaws testing | Business logic flaws testing is a special form of abuse testing that can identify additional flaws in application business logic. This test is highly dependent on each specific application and is usually performed manually by a group of people that understand application logic well enough. | Release & Test | Technical | Detective |
| Promote to production | Promotion of production is formal acceptance of moving application from staging to production environment. This step can be done manually or can happen automatically, depending on the pipeline, tollgates and CI system. | Deploy | Administrative |  |
| Manual Signoff | Manual signoff is last step that is done in the pipeline before application ends up in production. It is formal "approval" and "order" that is done manually, usually in change management or ticketing system by respective manager. This step can be obsolete in some pipelines. In fact, removing or automating this step automatically changes CI pipeline into CI/CD pipeline, as deployments also can happen on continuous basis. | Deploy | Administrative | Preventive |
| Secrets injection | Secrets injection is normally automated step of assigning user rights and system accounts to an application that runs in production. The most secure way of storing secrets is to store them in the special systems where they are handled and rotated automatically. | Deploy | Technical | Preventive |
| Continuous Security Verification | Continuous Security Verification is an automated step (that can also in addition be done manually on a regular basis) or performing DAST-like non-invasive penetration test against an application running in production. For some particular security standards and frameworks, such tests are mandated. | Operate & Monitor | Technical | Detective |
| RASP (Runtime Application Self-Protection) | Runtime Application Self-Protection is a protection mechanism of running application that has insight into application logic, configuration, and data event flows. It makes it highly accurate and working even in the event where perimeter protection has been breached. Usually, RASP can be achieved by integrating special agent/module into application code, but sometimes it can be done by a platform software/agents (for example, Kubernetes agents, WAF, DBFW etc.). RASP can prevent security incidents from happening and protect application in the runtime. | Operate & Monitor | Technical | Corrective |
| Red Teaming | Red Teaming is a special kind of penetration testing that is performed manually as part of bigger exercise. Red Teaming can be again mandated by external regulation (TIBER-EU, for example) and these tests can also include multiple attack vectors and techniques, such as social engineering etc. | Operate & Monitor | Technical | Detective |
| Chaos experiments and resiliency tests | Chaos experiments and specific resiliency tests can be performed based on requirements and infrastructure capabilities application is hosted on. Business Continuity Management and Disaster Recovery Tests normally fall under resiliency testing and applications in scope need to adhere with them. In addition, for micro workloads that are centrally orchestrated and for some of cloud workloads, it is also possible to perform chaos experiments and tests by shutting down parts of the clusters, entire clusters, datacenters or even regions. Application and orchestration self-healing behavior is then analyzed. | Operate & Monitor | Technical | Preventive |
| Logging and Security Monitoring | Logging and Security Monitoring comprises all techniques and systems that are related to checking application metrics and behavior in production. Integration with central logging systems, SIEMs, SOC/NOC, alerting and performance monitoring systems are done in this step. | Operate & Monitor | Technical | Detective |
| Operational compliance | Operational compliance is a step which comprises alignment of Ops team with Standard Operational Procedures, Policies and Frameworks, Operational Blueprints and other mandated guides/best practices. | Operate & Monitor | Administrative | Detective |
| Operational Blueprints | Operational Blueprints are input for secure operations on a given platform/system. They are comprised into visual infographic documents and combine industry best practices tailored for specific platform/Ops team needs and capabilities. Operational Blueprints in form of checklist can substitute need of formal Security Review. | Operate & Monitor | Administrative | Preventive |
| Cross-team Collaboration | Cross-team Collaboration is a method of bringing people with different knowledge and expertise together. This method is proven to be highly effective in reaching common targets and should preferably stay as flat as possible and embrace direct contacts between members without excessive bureaucracy. | Plan | Administrative |  |
| Knowledge Management | Knowledge Management and future proofing is an idea of having common space where best practices and real-world experience is shared. Future proofing component is part of knowledge security - for example, it answers question which skills and expertise will be required in the same role within 5 years from now. | Plan | Administrative |  |
| Security Education | Security Education is a process of obtaining security-related knowledge that is required for fulfilling concrete job role. For development, this is partly compliance-driven, various topics need to be taught for specific teams on periodic basis. There is also some common knowledge that each developer needs to obtain. | Plan | Administrative | Preventive |
| Security Awareness | Security Awareness is a training and knowledge set that is required for every employee. Unlike Security Education, it is not directed towards specific group of people. Regular training covers topics of basic interest and is a preventative mechanism that helps not to make common mistakes and fall victim to a phishing attempt, for example. Security Awareness also teaches some basics of secure operations, such as password management, browser and email security etc. that relate to daily activities performed by everyone. | Plan | Administrative | Preventive |
| Security Culture & Shift-Left | Security Culture & Shift-Left is a set of customs and adopted rules among development community that allow enablement of controls and responsibilities shift earlier in the process (pipeline). With great power comes great responsibility. | Plan | Administrative |  |
| Risk Management / NPAP | Risk Management / NPAP (New Product Approval Process) is a milestone and process of identifying new risks that are related to current investment opportunity (product) and mitigating them to a tolerable level. NPAP is a formal process of approving new product for development/production use. | Plan | Administrative | Preventive |
| Threat & Risk Landscape | Threat & Risk Landscape is a metrics document that serves as an input to Threat Modelling and Risk Management. It identifies most common threat factors that will target particular enterprise (or particular sector) in an observable time frame. | Plan | Administrative | Preventive |
| Application Security Risk Matrix | Application Security Risk Matrix is a graphical representation of risks and their magnitude that are relevant to particular application (one being analyzed). | Plan | Administrative | Preventive |
| Center of Excellence | Center of Excellence is a dedicated team that develops rules and customs that are later adopted by a wider developers community. It is also single point of contact for questions related to developers Security Culture & Shift-Left. | Plan | Administrative |  |
