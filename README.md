# SDLC library of security controls and practices


| Name  | Description | Phase | Type | Function |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Process stage  | Process step references standard process alignment and activities that are required to kickstart an initiative.  | Plan | Administrative | Preventive |
| Idea  | Idea step references start of activity. Depending on Enterprise Architecture steps definition, it can be named differently.  | Plan | Administrative |  |
| Feature definition  | In the feature definition step business defines which features and security requirements product needs to have and align to. This step is an input to Design and Architecture.  | Plan | Technical |  |
| Architecture  | This step maps overall Architecture guidelines to future product, including which technologies to use, how to fit future product into organization portfolio, align it with Enterprise Architecture and practices used in the organization.  | Plan | Technical | Preventive |
| Compliance & Risk assessment  | Compliance & Risk assessment is an initial control step for process alignment. This step is needed to validate that future product will stay within compliance frame and that all risks that will be associated with it will stay within risk appetite. This step can also mandate and drive particular Design decisions. Third party and future Supplier Chain Management alignment with requirements also happens in this step.  | Plan | Administrative | Preventive |
| Design  | Design step takes Architecture as an input and creates product detailed design according to industry best practices. Output Design should be detailed enough for Threat Modelling evaluation.  | Plan | Technical | Preventive |
| Threat modelling  | Threat modelling along with Design, Compliance & Risk assessment and Architecture phases is residing in the recurrent "bubble". Threat modelling is a security process which identifies, categorizes and analyzes threats and vulnerabilities applicable for the product (application) being built. Output of this step is an actual model - design/diagram of the system, list of threats and controls for mitigation. There are multiple methodologies available for threat modelling, overall idea of this step is to identify gaps and also places where applicable countermeasures have greatest effect. In case it is not possible to mitigate risks to tolerable extent, Design and/or Architecture need to be fixed. In a way, Threat Modelling is a control gate of Planning phase.  | Plan | Technical | Preventive |
| CI/CD pipeline design | CI/CD pipeline design is an initial design of SDLC and related pipeline based on service Compliance Requirements, Threat Modelling, Design and other software requirements. | Plan | Administrative | Preventive |
